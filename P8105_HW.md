Homework 1

This is my solution to Homework 1.

*First I am going to load the packages I need.*

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.2     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.0.3     ✓ dplyr   1.0.2
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.2     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   1.3.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.0

    ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

## Problem 1

*Then I created a data frame with the specified elements*

``` r
prob1_df =
  tibble(
    samp=rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    factor_vec = factor (c("low","low","low","mod", "mod","mod", "mod", "high","high","high"))
  )
```

*I then took the mean of each variable in my data frame.*

``` r
    mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.08950918

``` r
    mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
    mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
    mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I cannot take the mean of the character vector or the factor vector,
because R does not recognize these as numbers.

``` r
    as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,samp_gt_0)) 
    as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
    as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,factor_vec))
```

I can convert the logical and factor vectors to numeric but I can’t do
the same thing with character vectors. I couldn’t take the factor vector
as a mean, but if I want to, I can convert this into a numeric vector
and then take the mean. I can’t do this with a character vector - this
may be because R can’t find a way to meaningfully assign numbers to
characters.

``` r
    as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,samp_gt_0))*pull(prob1_df,samp)
```

    ##  [1] 0.7091083 0.0000000 0.7918493 0.1185767 1.5948644 0.0000000 0.2247299
    ##  [8] 0.0000000 0.9948395 0.0000000

``` r
    as.factor(pull(prob1_df,samp_gt_0))*pull(prob1_df,samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)), pull(prob1_df, : '*'
    ## not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
    as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df,samp_gt_0)))*pull(prob1_df,samp)
```

    ##  [1]  1.4182165 -0.5764899  1.5836987  0.2371533  3.1897288 -0.9451379
    ##  [7]  0.4494597 -1.3166823  1.9896789 -0.7005662

## Problem 2

*First, I loaded the penguin dataset*

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The *Penguins* dataset has 344 observations represented by rows and 8
variables (species, island, sex, bill length, bill depth, flipper
length, year, and body mass in grams), which are displayed in the
columns. Data was collected between 2007 and 2009. There are three
species of penguin included in this study: Adelie (152), Chinstrap (68),
and Gentoo (124). The study was conducted over three islands: the Bisco,
Dream, and Torgersen islands. Almost half of penguins (48.84%) were
sampled on Biscoe Island, while slightly more than two-thirds (36.05%)
were on Dream Island.

An average penguin in this dataset has a flipper that is 200.92mm long
(min=. Their bills are, on average, 43.92mm long and 17.15mm deep. The
mean weight of penguins included in this study is 4201.75 grams. Almost
half (48.83%) of penguins were male, while 11 were missing data on
gender.

``` r

This is my scatterplot of bill and flipper length by penguin species\!
I’m really proud of this.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(colour = species)) + ggtitle("Penguin Bill and Flipper Length in mm") + labs (y = "Flipper Length (mm)", x = "Bill Length (mm)")
```
